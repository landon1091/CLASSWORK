# Acomplishments on this project. 

I accomplished a better understanding of how components and routers come toghether in React while working in a team environment. 

## What I did well on and what I could improve on. 

I believe I did well on asking questions when I needed to and using my resources to work out the problems I was running into. 
I could improve on my communication with my team and my overall understanding React and how it comes together.
